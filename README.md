Hello All

My name is Jacob and I love programing in the future I would love to become a web developer or a computer programmer.
I am very keen to learn new programming languages and expand my knowledge on the different languages.
I know the basics of html, css, php and javascript but I would like to expand my knowledge so I know more about the different languages.
